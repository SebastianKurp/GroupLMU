This assignment allows the user to store several text files in memory and then search them for keywords or special characters.  In addition to this, users can write notes, highlight them, and store them for access anywhere, all from a new GUI.

To run:

    download git branch or other terminal

    clone into the directory of your choice
    git clone git@github.com:SebastianKurp/GroupLMU.git

    ensure python version installed (version 3 at least)

    go into GroupLMU/testweb, run

    pip install django-debug-toolbar
 
    python -m http.server
	        or
